## Introduction

After a sleepless night of poring through React Documentation, I was motivated by my good friend [Sai Kishore Komanduri](https://github.com/fatman-) to build this small Snakes and Ladders game. Here's the first draft. 

## Game Rules

- It's a two player game. Player 1 is white.

- Each player takes turns to roll the dice, generating a random number.

- Whoever reaches 100 first is the winner.

- The last move is shown in the console.

## Usage

- Ensure that NodeJS is installed.

- Download/clone this repository, and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

- The game opens at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
